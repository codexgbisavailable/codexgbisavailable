- 👋 Hi, I’m @codexgbisavailable
- 👀 I’m interested in developing web pages, structuring taxonomies and pitching solutions to prospective clients.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything just now because I'm facing a very steep learning curve. Are there any other over-50s in the community who are making a complete career change as I am?
- Webbie people have so far been very helpful to me and I like the spirit of collaboration.
- 📫 How to reach me I'm not quite ready to provide but will do so soon. I hope we can get to know each; is it possible via GitHub?
- TTFN, Janie...
